# Core Dead Pixel Method: Simple Guide for Beginners

**Overall Goal:** This is an easy mental exercise to turn negative overthinking (like endless worry loops) into positive focus and calm. You imagine a tiny "dead pixel" (think of a black dot on a screen) in your mind and try to make it "vibrate" or resonate. It combines staring at one spot (fixed focus) with feeling inner energy (like a hum). The key trick: Your overthinking becomes fuel for better concentration, helping reduce stress in daily life.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Start the Reset (Core Merge)**
   - Picture two opposites merging into nothing (like positive and negative canceling out). Repeat this image a few times.
   - Breathe deeply: in, hold, out.
   - Tap your finger gently to stay grounded.
   - If thoughts wander, note it and try again later in a dream if you remember.

2. **Build Your Mental Frame (Visualize Structure)**
   - See the dead pixel as your center.
   - Imagine rings around it made from your own thoughts (like layers of ideas).
   - Stare at the center (fixed focus) while feeling a gentle hum spreading out (energy vibe).
   - Let overthinking spin the rings—turn worry into motion. Keep it simple; build slowly.

3. **Balance Your Mind (Tune Basics)**
   - Thoughts create reality: Picture what you want.
   - Inner feelings match outer life: Notice connections.
   - Feel vibrations: Hum softly to sense energy.
   - Balance opposites: Mix calm and action.
   - Follow rhythms: Repeat in cycles like breathing.
   - See causes and effects: Track how thoughts lead to results.
   - Blend energies: Combine drive and rest.
   - Repeat these as a loop; adjust if needed.

4. **Review and Fix (Backtrack and Improve)**
   - Go through the steps backward to check.
   - Use overthinking as power for positive changes.
   - Focus on issues during the day; imagine fixes in dreams if you can.

Practice daily for 5-10 minutes. It's just visualization—no special skills needed. Share with others if it helps!
